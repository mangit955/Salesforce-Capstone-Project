# üß© Employee Onboarding Platform (Salesforce Capstone Project)

## üìå Introduction / Objective
The **Employee Onboarding Platform** in Salesforce is designed to **automate and streamline every stage of onboarding**, making HR processes efficient, transparent, and error-free.  
It eliminates manual follow-ups, reduces compliance risks, and improves employee experience by providing real-time visibility to HR and managers.

---

## üß† Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle with manual, inconsistent, and delayed onboarding processes.  
Current challenges include:
- Lack of centralized employee onboarding data
- Manual tracking of tasks and documents
- Delayed approvals from managers and departments
- Limited visibility of onboarding status across teams

This project aims to solve these challenges by building an end-to-end onboarding platform inside Salesforce.
